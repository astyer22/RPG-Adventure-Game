Adventure Quest Game
Welcome to the Adventure Quest Game! This project was created as part of a journey to learn Java programming and develop a fun, interactive text-based adventure game.

Introduction
The Adventure Quest Game is a Java-based text adventure that immerses players into a fantasy realm filled with challenges, battles, and epic quests. It was developed with the primary goal of learning Java programming concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), user input handling, and basic game mechanics implementation.

Game Overview
In this game, players embark on a heroic journey where they encounter various levels, each with its own unique storyline and challenges. Players name their character, engage in battles against monsters, and ultimately face powerful bosses. The game offers a blend of strategic decision-making and chance, making each playthrough unique and engaging.

Features
Dynamic Storylines: Explore different levels with compelling narratives and challenges.
Randomized Battles: Encounter a variety of monsters with randomized attributes and engage in turn-based battles.
Player Customization: Name your character.
Interactive Gameplay: Choose actions during battles such as attacking or using potions strategically.
Progressive Difficulty: Face increasingly challenging foes as you progress through the game's levels.
End Game Victory: Conclude your adventure by defeating all levels and emerging as the ultimate hero!

Below are websites that I used to get familiar with Java. I also consulted CHATGPT and Github Co-piolet when i got stock and need some direction or editiing help.

Java is a high-level programming language known for its platform independence, strong typing, and object-oriented paradigm. It is widely used for developing applications ranging from web services to mobile apps due to its robustness and versatility.

# Future Work


- Item 1: I need to get the shop working so that the players can buy potions.
- Item 2: Currently on each level the player needs to defeat a random amount of monsters between 8-10. Once those are have been killed they should be able to fight the boss, win and got to the shop before entering the next level. However, right now the boss and shop are being skipped so the player just moves on to the next level without getting any items to heal or beef their stats. To make the game more succseful I need to fix that.
